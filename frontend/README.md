# :dart: OppMatch

_AI-Powered Opportunity Matching Platform_

OppMatch is an AI-powered platform designed to bridge the gap between students and career opportunities by leveraging multiple intelligent agents that automate and optimize the discovery and matching process for internships, scholarships, and grants.  
The platform uses CVs (PDF or LinkedIn) as input, analyzes them through a multi-agent system, and returns highly relevant opportunities tailored to the user's profile.

## :jigsaw: Problem

- Students struggle to find relevant opportunities due to information overload and scattered platforms.
- Valuable internships and scholarships go unnoticed because of poor matching systems.
- Recruiters and institutions spend too much time screening mismatched applications.
